Description: Create a program that maintains a task list for the user. 
  The user should be able to view the current task, list all of the tasks, 
  mark the current task complete, or to add a new task. 
  The program will read the list from a file (‘tasklist.txt’) when the program
  begins and then store the updated list by overwriting the old contents when 
  the user quits the program.
